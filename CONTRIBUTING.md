# Contributing

## How to contribute?

- For contribute, fork this repo and add in your forked repo a new branch with a descriptive title of what you will change

- The main file to change is the [data.json](./src/data.json).If you add new topi, update also the [tags.json](./src/tags.json)

- The PR should have as title the name of the things that were added. For example, if you added a react repo, the title must be Repo:React
### Images

For adding images in the `imagen`attribute, you may add the default ones for each category:

+ Github Repos: https://telegra.ph/file/fb2b6c7bb033108e86c4d.jpg
+ API: https://telegra.ph/file/85f2c4e4032e9355c13fb.jpg
+ YouTube: https://telegra.ph/file/6dddf1209bc82f98280c9.jpg
+ VsCode extension: https://telegra.ph/file/d15829a057ec7409e080f.jpg
+ WebPage: if web-page, you should add their logo with a image link that works fine.I recommend the [telegram bot](https://t.me/HK_telegraph_BOT) i use that is free.

#### Image limitation

The image must be square one, and limited to 50kb for best web page performance.
