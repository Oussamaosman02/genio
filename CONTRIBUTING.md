# Contributing

## How to contribute?

- For contribute, fork this repo and add in your forked repo a new branch with a descriptive title of what you will change.

- The main file to change is the [data.json](./src/data.json). If you add new topic, update also the [tags.json](./src/tags.json)

- The json format is something like this:

```json
{
  "title": "Title",
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "description": "Short description of the page",
  "tags": ["example"]
}
```

- The PR should have as title the name of the things that were added. For example, if you added a react repo, the title must be `Repo: React`
